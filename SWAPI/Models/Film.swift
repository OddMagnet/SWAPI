                It is a period of civil war.

                Rebel spaceships, striking

                from a hidden base, have won

                their first victory against

                the evil Galactic Empire.

                spies managed to steal secret\r\nplans to the Empire's

                ultimate weapon, the DEATH

                STAR, an armored space

                station with enough power

                to destroy an entire planet.

                sinister agents, Princess

                Leia races home aboard her

                stolen plans that can save her

                people and restore
